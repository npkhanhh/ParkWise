# ParkWise

The inspiration of ParkWise is from our team membersâ€™ terrible parking experience when going to CBD or campus during hours, and the good experience to book sharing house by using Airbnb.
So ParkWise aims to help drivers find a parking spot easier and improve the utilisation of car parking resources, which can also contribute to less traffic issues and a better world.

Nowadays, it is not convenient for people to find a parking spot in CBD or university campus. And it worsens traffic congestion when people are struggling for finding a parking spot in rush hour. However, some parking spaces of houses are vacant when their owners drive to work during day time, which causes a waste of resources. 

Therefore, we came up with our idea to solve such problems. Our aim is to tell people how many parking spots are available and allow them to book one parking spot in advance. We collect all of three parking resources, including street parking area, private car park, and residents who are willing to rent out their parking spots. Consequently, ParkWise can help city council to relieve traffic jam, attract more customers for private car parks, reduce the cost of traffic infrastructure and help residents earn more money.
